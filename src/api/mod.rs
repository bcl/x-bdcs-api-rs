//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The API server uses the [Nickel.rs](http://nickel.rs) web framework to handle requests.  The
//! handler functions are called by Nickel as part of its Middleware plugin system.
//!
//! The [bdcs::db](bdcs/db/index.html) module is used for the database operations. None of the
//! handlers should be executing SQL on the database directly.
//!
//! Requests are via HTTP for now, eventually it will be https only.
//!
//! # Methods
//!
//! * `GET` - is used to retrieve results from the server. No changes are made to the state of the
//!   server using a `GET` request.
//! * `POST` - is used to initiate a change or an action on the server. eg. write a Recipe, start a
//!   compose, etc.
//!
//! All other HTTP methods are unused at this time.
//!
//! # HTTP Status Codes
//!
//! Status codes will be used along with JSON responses to indicate the success or failure of
//! requests.
//!
//! * `2xx` - Success, JSON response depends on the resource being accessed.
//! * `4xx` - Request failure, additional details in the JSON error response.
//! * `5xx` - Server errors, additional details in the JSON error response.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! API access is always versioned, and old versions will remain accessible unless explicitly
//! deprecated for 1 version release cycle.
//!
//! The base path of the URLs are `/api/v0/` with the REST resource root starting after that.
//!
//! # REST
//!
//! URLs are used to describe the resources being accessed. Generally trying to follow the advice
//! [found here](http://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/05/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api/)
//! except for point 6, HATEOAS.
//!
//! * Use plural nouns for resources, and HTTP Methods as the verbs.
//! * GET does not alter the state of the server
//! * Use sub-resources for relations (eg. TODO Add an example)
//! * Use query parameters to filter, sort, and paginate results. eg. `/api/v0/recipes/list?limit=50&offset=42`
//!
//! # Responses
//!
//! All responses will be JSON objects. Responses to GET requests will have the response included
//! under a key set to the resource root. eg. `GET /api/v0/recipes/list` will return the list as
//! `{"recipes":[{"name":value, ...}, ...]}`
//!
//! Responses may also include extra metadata in other keys. eg. limit, offset, and total for
//! pagination results.
//!
//! ## Error Responses
//!
//! In addition to the HTTP Error codes, extra information will be included in a JSON response object with
//! `{"id": "internal error id", "msg": "Human readable message, suitable for passing to users"}`
//!
//! # Authentication
//!
//! This is still TBD.
//!
//! ## Authorization: Bearer tokens
//!
//! ## Basic Auth tokens
//!
