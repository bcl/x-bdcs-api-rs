//! ## Overview
//!
//! The bdcs crate contains 3 modules. The [db](db/index.html) module for operations related to the
//! sqlite metadata store, and the [api](api/index.html) module for handling requests to the bdcs
//! API Server. The config module only exports the [BDCSConfig](config/struct.BDCSConfig.html)
//! struct which is used to pass configuration data to the API handlers.
